### Typography

#### Overview
Typography plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience and establishing a strong visual identity for Japan Market. Our font choices have been carefully selected to align with the elegant and high-quality aesthetic of Japanese products, ensuring a cohesive and engaging experience throughout the site.

#### Font Selections

 - [Archivo Black](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Black)\
   Used for headlines and key emphasis points, Archivo Black delivers a bold, energetic, and attention-grabbing presence, perfectly suited for a fitness-focused platform.

 - [Exo 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2)\
   Selected for body text and general content, Exo 2 combines a futuristic and elegant design, ensuring readability while maintaining a sleek, modern feel.

 - Sans Serif (Fallback Font)\
    In cases where the primary fonts are not available, a generic sans-serif typeface will be used to preserve readability and consistency.

#### Conclusion
By pairing Archivo Black with Exo 2, Infinite Fitness achieves a balance between high-impact visuals and smooth readability. This combination ensures a compelling and motivating user experience, aligning with the platform’s goal of promoting an active lifestyle.
